# This is a massive eCommerce web application designed and developed by Asoh Yannick using the MERN stack.
#Hi, my name is Asoh Yannick, and I'm the creator, designer, and developer of this massive e-commerce web application, which features numerous functionalities on both the client-side and server-side. It utilizes core Node.js and Express.js APIs and middleware, along with React.js to build highly intuitive and seamless user interfaces. The MongoDB database management system is used to create, store, query, and retrieve sensitive data. This web application leverages the MERN stack and external APIs and middleware from the global developer community, who are passionate advocates of the MERN stack. My goal in developing this application is both personal—enhancing my skills as a software developer—and collective, aiming to provide a robust, secure, and highly functional web application for other developers.
```
#The technologies and dependencies used to develop this massive e-commerce web application, which includes numerous functionalities on both the frontend and backend, are as follows:
# Technologies used include the following:

MongoDB: A NoSQL, or non-relational, database management system used to create, store, update, and retrieve important data for my users.
```
# Express.js: A very fast, unopinionated, minimalistic, and secure Node.js web framework used to build highly robust, maintainable, and functional APIs and microservices in a web application.
```
# This massive e-commerce project has greatly leveraged all the core Express.js APIs and middleware, including application-level, router-level, built-in, error-handling, and third-party APIs, to build a very secure and robust web application..
```
# I also created my own custom APIs and middleware, especially for error handling, to better manage custom errors and ensure a seamless flow between incoming HTTP requests to my APIs and backend, and outgoing responses to the appropriate requests made by my users (frontend).;

# React.js: The most popular, fast, and robust JavaScript framework (or UI library) used to build seamless, intuitive, and secure user interfaces.
```
# Node.js: An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment used to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on the server (backend) of a full-stack web application. 
```
# I strongly utilized Node.js core APIs and middleware, such as HTTP, path, file system, and createServer, among others, to build a very secure, robust, and highly functional web application on the backend while exposing the APIs and middleware to the frontend and other software components (systems).
```
# Third-party APIs and packages (or dependencies) used on the frontend include the following:
```
# React Router: A JavaScript and React.js navigation library used for creating dynamic client-side routing and securing API routes and middleware on the frontend of this massive e-commerce web application, or my single-page web application.
```
# Axios: An HTTP external library used to handle or make HTTP requests to a web server or APIs running on the internet.
# Redux Toolkit: A JavaScript state management library used to manage and control the global state behavior of a web application such as React.js.
```
# Redux Persist: A library that seamlessly integrates with Redux to enable the persistence of my application's state.
# Bootstrap: The most popular CSS framework with JavaScript plugins, used to build highly responsive, mobile-first, and functional web applications.
# Styled-Components
```
#React Toastify: One of the most popular libraries for creating toast notifications in React. With React Toastify, you can easily create toast notifications and alerts in your massive e-commerce web application.
```
# To install all the dependencies and get this web application up and running on your machine after downloading, cloning, or forking my GitHub repository, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:.
```
#1. The latest Node.js version with LTS support installed on your machine, which also includes NPM, running smoothly.

# Set up the environment variables for the Express backend APIs and middleware properly in your local development environment, and ensure you have a stable internet connection to install all the necessary dependencies.
```
# Now run the command npm install && npm run dev to install all the dependencies of this project on your machine and start the local development server for both the frontend and backend..
